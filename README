Welcome to emux51, the modular 8051 emulator.

		Priorities:
*	modularity
*	portability
*	simplicity


		Destination platforms:
*	At first, I want to use this under standard Linux distributions.
*	At second, some people wants to use this under standard Windows.
*	At third, I would be happy if this will be able to run
	on any Posix compatabile operation system.


		Status:
*	Module interface is done.
*	Indirect memory access.
*	Basic instructions are ok.
*	Timers are broken now.

		TODO:
*	Fix timers.
*	Do interrupts.
*	Do a lot of instructions.
*	Split architecture dependent code / only windows code into separated file.
