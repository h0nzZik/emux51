*	Welcome to emux51, the modular 8051 emulator.			*

		Priorities:
*	modularity							*
*	portability							*
*	simplicity							*


		Destination platforms:
*	At first, I want to use this under standard Linux distributions	*
*	At second, some people wants to use this under standard Windows	*
*	At third, I would be happy if this will be able to run		*
	on any Posix compatabile operation system.


		Status:
*	Module interface is ok.						*
*	Indirect memory access.						*
*	Basic instructions are ok.					*
*	Timers may be good now.						*
*	Simple graphic interface.					*
*	Timer interrupts are ok.					*
*	External interrupts are broken and disabled.			*
*	make ARCH=WIN32 perform cross-compiling to WIN32 architecture	*

		Modules:
*	Leds								*
*	Switches							*

		TODO:
*	!! PSW features not implemented yet. Do it!!			*
*	env settings							*
*	Fix external interrupts.					*
*	Improve UI.							*
*	Do a lot of instructions.					*
*	Add data types for emulator pointers and data types.		*
*	[Do some timer stuff.]						*


		Actual instruction set:
*	All 'mov' and 'movc' instructions. Movx are ignored now ;)
