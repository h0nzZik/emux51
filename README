Welcome to emux51, the modular 8051 emulator.

		Priorities:
*	modularity
*	portability
*	simplicity


		Destination platforms:
*	At first, I want to use this under standard Linux distributions.
*	At second, some people wants to use this under standard Windows.
*	At third, I would be happy if this will be able to run
	on any Posix compatabile operation system.


		Status:
*	
*	Timers are broken now.

		TODO:
*	Fix timers.
